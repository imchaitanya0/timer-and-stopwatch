# timer-and-stopwatch
This was my second project on web development and this project is about to create "timer and stopwatch". It is a frontend 
development project. In this project i used HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT to create dynamic and responsive web page.

The project was built using a simple yet powerful combination of pure HTML, CSS, and javascript, also known as "vanilla javascript."
You can find  codes in index.html,Script.js,Style.css files for html,js,css respectively.
